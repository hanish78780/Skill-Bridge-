## Option 4: Technical Deep-Dive

🔧 **Tech Case Study: Building SkillBridge - A Real-Time Collaboration Platform**

Just completed a comprehensive full-stack project that tackles an interesting technical challenge: coordinating distributed teams in real-time while maintaining data consistency.

**The Architecture:**

**Frontend Layer:**
• React 19 with hooks & context API
• Real-time state sync via Socket.io client
• Optimistic UI updates for responsiveness
• Framer Motion for smooth animations
• Tailwind CSS for responsive design

**Backend Layer:**
• Node.js/Express REST API
• MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
• WebSocket server (Socket.io) for real-time features
• JWT authentication with HttpOnly cookies
• Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Third-Party Integrations:**
• Cloudinary for file storage & CDN
• Razorpay for payment processing
• Google OAuth for authentication
• Nodemailer for transactional emails

**Technical Challenges Solved:**

1️⃣ **Real-Time Synchronization**
